indeed

- want to give big thanks to all of my interviewers, the interview is really a positive experience! It really makes me feel like 'wow true indeed is truly a big company and everything comes in standard ways.'. Every one is nice and friendly, will guide me when i have troubles dealing with my coding problems. 

- Negative: I am sorry to hear that though, however I totally understand the decision. I still have some way to go especially for my coding ability. I will practice more!

  - how long is the cool down period,

  - Are there any new-grad positions and can I apply for the them

- Positive:
- codingï¼š
  - hints bugs
- team-based
  - 















Hello, I am Tianran Wu and writing to ask you about some questions about internship.

I was enrolled in 2020 October and currently a 2nd year master student. My graduation is September 2022 and My master defense is in August.

I want to do an Internship in Tokyo from May 1 to Aug 30 for 28hrs a week (My visa already allowed it). 

For credits: I have achieved 28 credits and i will complete the other 2 credits by attending semi. So I do not need to count it in my credits. 

For the master defense: If online participation is not allowed, I can get back immediately for the master defense during August and take it physically. 

I want to ask if it is possible that I am allowed to take the internship? If it is OK, I want to ask about the next progress of doing the internships. Thank you very much!

Best Regards,
