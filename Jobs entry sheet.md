*Led…*

*Handled…*

*Managed…*

*Responsible for*…

Most [resume bullet points](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-write-resume-bullets-thatll-make-the-hiring-manager-pay-attention) start with the same words. Frankly, the same tired old words hiring managers have heard over and over—to the point where they’ve lost a lot of their meaning and don’t do much to [show off your accomplishments](https://www.themuse.com/advice/resume-revamp-how-to-turn-your-duties-into-accomplishments).

So, let’s get a little more creative, shall we? Next time you [update your resume](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-update-your-resume-in-30-minutesand-turn-in-an-impressive-typofree-version), switch up a few of those common words and phrases with strong, compelling action verbs that will catch hiring managers’ eyes.

Mercari is a very famous online market, especially for second-hands goods trading. I first began to use it to buy second-hand Anime-related goods, and it helped me sell my old apple watch. All the experiences are very friendly and pleasant. Besides, I am very impressed by the smart recommendations by Mercari, recommanding me what I really want but originally did not know.

It is really wonderful to use AI to help people find what they like and say goodbye to their old go-tos. And that is exactly what I want to be doing in my career.  As a new grad with software development background, the Software Engineer, this position really fits my experience. And it will be a great honour to work in Mercari. 作为一名深度学习相关的学生，觉得这个职位非常fit自己的experience，希望能够在mercari工作学习。

Internship @ Huawei Co., Ltd

I worked as an Algorithm Engineer Internship in Huawei Central Hardware Research Center, Hangzhou, from Oct. 2018 to Aug. 2019. This group of 10 people, led by Prof. Hongkai Xiong and Dr Zhanying He, aimed at designing efficient neural networks, which would then help the machine learning algorithm deployment on Huawei's Ascend chips. The tasks for our group involved acceleration and compression of DNNs. 

I am responsible for the compression part, the quantization of neural networks. The proposed method touches the limit of DNNs' quantization, with a theoretical explanation based on variational Bayesian. Specifically, my jobs involved:
● Design a novel heterogeneous bit-width quantization for large-scale DNNs
● Proposed a variational Bayesian-based method to allocate bit-width
● Achieved 16x decrease for ResNet-50 storage and running memory

Engin et. al's paper [1] really caught my attention. They presented a novel method using dialog summary to facilize the video question answering task. It is thus unnecessary to use external human-annotated information like knowledge and scripts. Also, they achieved state-of-the-art accuracy and even outperformed human evaluation. What attracts me most is the way they assume the existing sentences already have enough information, and they could replace the expensive and time-consuming human-annotated information with the performance maintained. 
I noticed this paper because it used the same dataset I was using in my paper [2] centring on transfer learning. At that time I was also trying to reduce as many training resources with the help of existing models. This paper gave me a fresh idea, so now I am also heading in that direction to remove as many human-made things (even the original dataset itself), but in a different way: unsupervised learning.
